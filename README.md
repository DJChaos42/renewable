# renewable
Minecraft features multiple items and blocks which are not renewable, meaning that there are a limited number of them available in a given world. This has the potential to cause scarcity issues, especially on servers where players have to compete with each other over these resources. This pack is intended to resolve those issues by making these items renewable, either through crafting recipes, entity drops, or some other method.

A full list of changes made by the pack can be found below. This list can also be found in the "features" file within the pack.
