----
# Version 1.0.3
## Additions
- Obtaining/eating an Enchanted Golden Apple grants the "Overpowered" advancement
  - A fun little Easter egg for older players.

  - This isn't a renewability thing, tridents just make me angry.
## Changes
### Entity Loot Tables
- General
  - Most entity loot table modifications no longer replace the vanilla loot table. This should help with compatibility.
    - The exception is the Husk loot table, which needs to be overwritten in order to replace the iron ingot drop.
- Creepers
  - Disc Fragments and Otherside music disc now only drop if killed by the Warden's sonic boom attack, not its melee attack.
  - Have a chance to drop the Relic music disc when killed by suffocating in sand.
    - This change is intended to keep the drop in line with other music discs dropping from Creepers.
- Ender Dragon
  - The Elytra dropped by respawned Ender Dragons has a custom name.
- Husks
  - Have a chance to drop sand when killed.
  - No longer drop the Relic music disc.
## Removals
- Removed the pink petal recipe, as they can be duplicated using bone meal.
----
